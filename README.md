- BFFT: Birds of a Feather Flock Together

## Problem Statement
- There are various challenges with ordering delivery food for students who are currently living in the KAIST dormitory, due to the decreased number of people on the KAIST campus.

## Problem background
- Recently, a popularity on delivery food service has increased due to COVID-19 pandemic. According to [[1]], the number or ordering delivery food has increased 27 percent due to reinforced social distancing policy by government. This led to a shortage of deliverymen compared to the number of delivery food orders, and their workload increased excessively [[2]]. Students in the KAIST campus has decreased and most of them are staying in solitary-type room [[3]]. Therefore, students who were usually enjoying delivery food with their room-mate are having problem with ordering food as living alone now. Currently, it is difficult for students in KAIST to find friends to enjoy delivery food together. Also, The students are reluctant to order delivery food since the minimum cost to order the delivery food is usually expensive for them. Furthermore, The students are burdened with increasing tips for delivering food. [[4]].

## Motivation (Why social computing?)
- As every person has their own food preference and a range of food is diverse, it is hard to predict what they want to eat. Also the problem of ordering delivery food is mostly based on the missing people due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The easiest solution is just to gather people for ordering delivery food together. To group people and choose what kind of food they will eat, we should need communication between people gathered to order food rather than an expert's opinion or a machine. Social computing can help people solve this problem much faster by gathering people online. Moreover, people who gather together can discuss what kind of food they order to satisfy all members in their group.

## Top 3 HMW questions (This order is not a ranking.)
- First Question) 1. HMW make people not care about the number of people they need?
  - Reason: The most general problem that people face when they order delivery food is the lack of people to order together. This is the main reason why we picked this HMW question. As mentioned in the problem background, this question is related to the lack of people to order together with the student who lives alone in the KAIST dormitory.
  
- Second Question) 6. HMW make the cost for delivery food reduce?
  - Reason: The biggest problem why people avoid to enjoy delivery food alone is due to the high cost of some menus that has a bigger size than for one person. Also as delivery takes some delivery fee for each order, the frequency and amount we have to pay for each delivery increases. These factors seem to be the major factors that make people afraid of ordering delivery alone but go out to eat.
  
- Third Question) 12. HMW satisfy people’s various needs for food?
  - Reason: Most people would like to eat a varied menu in one meal. However, economic constraints and leftovers make them difficult to enjoy this experience. In other words, they have difficulties on deciding only a limited amount of food for each delivery because of the diverse menu. So we thought that if we could solve the diverse needs of each person, it will be a solution that can satisfy many users.

## Top 3 solution ideas (This order is not a ranking.)
- First Solution) Gather people by restaurant, not by menu. (S6 of Q3)
  - Reason: As it is mentioned in the motivation and the reason why we picked this HMW, what a person prefers and owes differs very much. Many delivery shops usually have a diverse menu which has sets or combinations of two menus in one order. We thought that not limiting the order by the menu but by the restaurant could be a better solution that can gather people faster and satisfy more people with one order and several different menus.
  
- Second Solution) Recommend and order cost-effective menus with more people. (S2 of Q2)
  - Reason: The more delivery food you order, the more cost-effective menus will be offered by restaurants. However, there is a tendency to remain too much leftovers if ordering the cost-effective menu alone. Ordering cost-effective menus with gathered people can help reduce the cost of the delivery food.
  
- Third Solution) Gather people who want to eat together easily after deciding a menu. (S1 of Q1)
  - Reason: We choose this as the top 3 solution ideas since this is an important idea for gathering and having food together. As delivery food does not have separate plates, it is hard to divide with others which will require people to gather and eat together. However, deciding a menu seems to be crashing with the first solution which decides by restaurant rather than menu. So, we plan to combine this idea with the first solution.
  
## Conclusion
-  Due to the shortage of personnel in the COVID-19 Pandemics, ordering delivery food within KAIST is difficult. From the contents from ideation, we plan to implement a platform that will allow people to gather and eat together according to the restaurants. Users can not only gather people easily to order together with, but also obtain an economical advantage by being recommended cost-effective menus in our platform. As the order is based on the restaurants, it is expected that the menu will need to be exchanged, so we are thinking about additional features (leaving comments or showing preferences).
