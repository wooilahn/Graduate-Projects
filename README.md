## Problem Statement
- There are various challenges with ordering delivery food for students who are currently living in the KAIST dormitory, due to the decreased number of people on the KAIST campus.

## Problem background
-  최근 코로나19의 영향으로 배달의 수요가 급증했습니다. 한 기사에 따르면, 사회적 거리두기의 강화로 인해 배달 음식 주문량이 27%가 증가하였습니다 [[1]]. 이로 인해 배달 음식 주문 수에 비해 배달원들이 부족해지는 상황이 발생하였고, 그들의 업무량이 과도하게 증가했습니다.[[2]] KAIST 교내에서는 기숙사에 거주하는 학생 수가 줄어들었고, 학교에 남아있는 대부분의 학생들이 독방에 거주하고 있습니다.[[3]] 실제로 기존에는 룸메이트와 함께 음식을 주문하던 학생들이 음식 주문에 어려움을 겪고 있는 경우가 많다고 합니다. 현재 KAIST 교내에 있는 학생들이 배달 음식을 함께 먹을 사람을 구하기 어려우며, 혼자 배달음식을 주문하기에는 가격과 양이 부담되기 때문에 학생들이 쉽게 배달 주문을 하기 어려운 상황입니다. 또한, 늘어가는 배달료 또한 소비자의 부담을 증가시키고 있습니다[[4]].

## Motivation (Why social computing?)
- As every person has their own food preference and a range of food is diverse, it is hard to predict what they want to eat. Also the problem of ordering delivery food is mostly based on the missing people due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The easiest solution is just to gather people. To group people for ordering delivery food, we will need communication rather than an expert or a machine. Social computing can help people solve this problem much faster by gathering people online. Moreover, people who gather together can share their opinions to satisfy everybody.

## HMW questions (at least 10)
1.  HMW make people not care about the number of people they need?
2.  HMW make people enjoy ordering delivery food itself?

4.  HMW help people not to feel hard to deliver food by themselves?
5.  HMW let people deliver what they want with no bother? 
6.  HMW make the cost for delivery food reduce?

## Top 3 HMW questions (This order is not a ranking.)
- First Question) 1. HMW make people not care about the number of people they need?
  - Reason: 
  
- Second Question) 6. HMW make the cost for delivery food reduce?
  - Reason: The biggest problem why people avoid to enjoy delivery food alone is due to the high cost of some menus that has a bigger size than for one person. Also as delivery takes some delivery fee for each order, the frequency and amount we have to pay for each delivery increases. These factors seem to be the major factors that make people afraid of ordering delivery alone but go out to eat.
  
- Third Question) 12. HMW satisfy people’s various needs for food?
  - Reason: Most people would like to eat a varied menu in one meal. However, economic constraints and leftovers make them difficult to enjoy this experience. In other words, they have difficulties on deciding only a limited amount of food for each delivery because of the diverse menu. So we thought that if we could solve the diverse needs of each person, it will be a solution that can satisfy many users.
  
## Solution ideas for your HMW questions
- First Question) 1. HMW make people not care about the number of people they need?
  - Solution 1) Gather people who want to eat together easily after deciding a menu. 
  - Solution 2) Just order a menu for 1 person. Make the restaurant divide the menu.
  - Solution 3) Make an online matching site that matches anyone near who prefers the similar menu.
  - Solution 4) Divide the food after ordering it with other people who need it.
  - Solution 5) Install storage for leftovers so they don’t have to care.
  - Solution 6) Allow people publicly show their status(e.g., hungry, full) and preference for the meal.
  
- Second Question) 6. HMW make the cost for delivery food reduce?
  - Solution 1) If pick-up service is available, volunteers in the group bring food from the restaurant.
  - Solution 2) Recommend and order cost-effective menus with more people.
  - Solution 3) Collect the coupons of members and use them for discounts.  
  - Solution 4) Minimize the delivery stage.
  - Solution 5) Group deliveries of the same menu to decrease delivery costs.
  
- Third Question) 12. HMW satisfy people’s various needs for food.
  - Solution 1) Gather people depending on their preferences.
  - Solution 2) Recommend people who want to share their food with others (or trade also).
  - Solution 3) Share leftovers to others. (Only eatable things)
  - Solution 4) Make restaurants share their menu to provide various food.
  - Solution 5) Register more restaurants providing large variation on food (like 피자나라 치킨공주).
  - Solution 6) Gather people by restaurant, not by menu.
  
## Top 3 solution ideas (This order is not a ranking.)
- First Solution) Gather people by restaurant, not by menu. (S6 of Q3)
  - Reason: As it is mentioned in the motivation and the reason why we picked this HMW, what a person prefers and owes differs very much. Many delivery shops usually have a diverse menu which has sets or combinations of two menus in one order. We thought that not limiting the order by the menu but by the restaurant could be a better solution that can gather people faster and satisfy more people with one order and several different menus.
  
- Second Solution) Recommend and order cost-effective menus with more people. (S2 of Q2)
  - Reason: The more delivery food you order, the more cost-effective menus will be offered by restaurants. However, there is a tendency to remain too much leftovers if ordering the cost-effective menu alone. Ordering cost-effective menus with gathered people can help reduce the cost of the delivery food.
  
- Third Solution) Gather people who want to eat together easily after deciding a menu. (S1 of Q1)
  - Reason: The biggest reason that we thought that this is in the top 3 ideas was that this is an important idea for gathering and having food together. As delivery food does not have separate plates, it is hard to divide with others which will require people to gather and eat together. However, deciding a menu seems to be crashing with the first solution which decides by restaurant rather than menu. So, we plan to combine this idea with the first solution.
